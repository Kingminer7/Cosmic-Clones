# Cosmic Clones
Ever played a platformer and thought it was too easy? Well not anymore! This mod adds clones of the player that kill you if you touch it. These clones follow with a delay, changable in settings.

## Styles
This mod comes with a few styles!
- Cosmic Mario: Based on Super Mario Galaxy. This style doesn't follow the 2-color system others do, instead using the cosmic look from the original.
- Cosmic Clone: Based on Super Mario Galaxy 2.
- Badeline: Based on Celeste. This style has a red trail to match the original.
- Custom: You can choose your own colors for the icon.
  - Custom sound effects are *planned*.
